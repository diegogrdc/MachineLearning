# Machine Learning

This repository was created to store notes and code developed during courses and certifications taken by me, mostly revolving around Machine Learning.

Currently, I'm coursing the ML Specialization (DeepLearning.AI and Stanford) in Coursera, but hoping to expand into more courses in the future after finishing this specialization
