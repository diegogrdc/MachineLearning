# Machine Learning

This repository was created to store notes and code developed during courses and certifications taken by me, mostly revolving around Machine Learning.

## ML Specialization

Completed the Machine Learning Specialization offered by Stanford University in collaboration with DeepLearning.AI.

I completed all three courses of the Machine Learning Specialization. I studied modern machine learning concepts, including supervised learning (linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, anomaly detection), recommender systems, and reinforcement learning. I learned some of the best practices for building machine learning models. I also gained practical skills to apply machine learning techniques to challenging real-world problems. 

## DL Specialization 

Currently coursing the Deep Learning Specialization offered by Stanford University in collaboration with DeepLearning.AI.
