Relevant Terms

|Term|Definitions|
|---|---|
|Neuron|Basic building block of Neural Networks. It takes inputs, performs calculations and gives an output called activation. Each one has weights and a bias|
|Activation| Value of a neuron after evaluation|
|Input|Data/Values, passed to the neurons|
|Weights|Determine the strength or importance of each connection between neurons|
|Bias|Constant value added to the sum of the product between input values and respective weights, used to accelerate/delay the activation of a given node|
|Activation function|Function used by each neuron to introduce the non-linearity phenomenon into the NN system|
|Tensor|Alternate way to call a matrix in ML|
|Precision|Out of all predicted positives, how many are truly positive|
|Recall|Out of all true positives, how many were correctly predicted|
|F1 Score| Helps measuring the tradeoff between precision and recall|
|Transfer Learning|Use data from a different task to help in your application|
|Data Synthesis|Using artificial data inputs to create new examples.|
|Data Augmentation| modifying an existing example to create a new example|
