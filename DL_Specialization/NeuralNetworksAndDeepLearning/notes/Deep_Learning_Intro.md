# Deep Learning Introduction

Deep Learning refers to the training of Neural Networks

## Neural Networks

Given some input features $\vec{x}$, we want to predict an output $y$. Given a lot of data examples, the goal is to find a function that maps correctly each input $x$ closely to the correct value $y$. This means Neural Networks are a part of *Supervised Learning*

This is done with Neural Networks. The main advantage of the Neural Network is that, with enough data, it can figure out the mapping on its own. This is done by training a network with multiple *layers* of *neurons*. Neurons receive certain inputs and give an output. By stacking neurons in *layers* and connecting them, we create a Neural Network.
